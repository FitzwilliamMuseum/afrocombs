Proud to be black and African. Growing up from a very cultural family background I’ve learnt to appreciate and accept that I’m different. As a teenager growing up I had kids from high school saying I’m not black, I’m Arab because of the softness of my hair and because I’m Somalian which is stupidness. So I’ve decided to write I’m ‘100% black African and proud’ on the back of my jacket which used to attract lots of attention.
