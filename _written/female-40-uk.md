I have always struggled with how to wear my afro hair. I alternate between plaits, hair extensions and wigs as a means to be presentable as well as socially acceptable. I find that when my hair is ‘straight’ I am ‘sexy’ to white males (as well as black) but when ‘natural’ I am an undesirable… It is an identity crisis on a daily basis!!! I wear my hair to feel good not for others!
