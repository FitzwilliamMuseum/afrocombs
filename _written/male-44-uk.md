Being born in the 70s my earliest memories of my parents were their afros and clothing. As African American children of the 70s my sibling and I all either wore our hair braided or in the afro style. Afro combs were always around the house. The ones I remember are the plastic comb, afro pick comb with clenched fist and my favourite was the foldable pick comb with the red and green handle.
