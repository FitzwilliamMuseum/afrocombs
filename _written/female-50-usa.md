My mother when I was about 12 years old, she put a product on my hair called an uncurl because my hair was very thick, long and wavy in texture. I remember I had these huge rollers in my hair that looked like this. I could not wear an Afro because it will part in the middle so I wore Afro puffs that look like this. My comb looked like this.
