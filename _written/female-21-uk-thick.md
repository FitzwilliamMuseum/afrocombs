I grew up with very long very thick hair and I relaxed my hair for a very long time. Recently, (1 Â½ years ago) I chopped my hair off and went natural, and I feel much happier and healthier, because I hated relaxing my hair. My new mission is learning more about my hair, and teaching others about it as well. Understanding is the key to progress.
