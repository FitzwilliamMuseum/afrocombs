My hair is very curly (blond Caucasian) and was always frizzy until I started using an afro comb and curly hair oils and products. When I was sixteen I was allowed to have my hair braided at an Afro-Caribbean
barber’s in Birmingham. It took 6-8 hours to braid and afterwards I had so much extra hair in it I struggled to tie it back at all! I had a fantastic summer with the braids, enjoying not having to comb then just spraying them with oil based spray that smell – delicious!
