I had no idea that the Afro comb has such a long and fascinating history! I was amazed to see the Fitzwilliam was doing an exhibition of them; I have used only Afro combs for my hair for many years as it is thick and wavy and goes very ‘frizzy’ if brushed! My current collection of combs includes a Cameroonian comb (bought in Cameroon by my sister for me in 2001) and a Malawian one (from Cape Maclear, on lake Malawi, designed for me in 2011) and 2 plastic ones, one of which was bought in Dunaújváros, Hungary. I will think of my combs’ 5000-6000 year old ancestors now when I use them!
