I remember my mother combing my hair for school when I was in Jamaica and I used to cry. I used to run off or hide in the morning, then end up getting dragged up by my mum on some joke thing. Eventually as I got older I started combing it more regularly and oiling it. The problem now is the ingrown hair in my beard and I end up combing and brushing my beard more than my head. What can I say â€¦ Black man problems.
