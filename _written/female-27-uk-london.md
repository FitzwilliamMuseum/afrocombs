I grew up mainly in London, in a predominantly white area, and have had a long journey with my hair. My mother’s English, my father’s Ugandan. A lot of tears, pain, boldness, experimenting, accepting, and fun! I think I’m still a long way off really understanding how all of God’s hair creations are equally beautiful. In honesty I still struggle against that old lie the more European your hair is, the more beautiful it is. Still on that journey. So much to say on this topic I want to write a book one day! Fabulous exhibition, thank you!!
