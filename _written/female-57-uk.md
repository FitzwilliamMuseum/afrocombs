Very interesting exhibition. I needed to make sure I chose my afro comb carefully, It mustnâ€™t be too flimsy, too wide, flexible but not too much so. The last thing I wanted was for the comb to break, not be able to com bout all the knots, or that I would have to spend too long combing if the teeth/prongs were too wide. This has brought back all those memories.
