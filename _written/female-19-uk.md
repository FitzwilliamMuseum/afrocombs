Comments about my hair in the last 12 months. “Can I touch it?” “Hey soul sister!” “It looks unprofessional, afros are intimidating” “How do you get it to stand up like that?” “If feels so weird!” “You have beautiful hair” “You look like a 70s crime fighter!” “Wow that hair is crazy” “I wish my hair was that interesting” “So when are you going to braid your hair?” “I wish I was brave enough to go natural too”.
