I recently cut all my hair which was a gigantic afro I’ve worn for years. Though much effort using picks, oils, and many wide tooth combs to get out the tangles I reached the state of “controlled messiness” everyone praised. Cutting all that hair gave me the impression I was free of the afro identity, my hair could not define me. Joke’s on me. It did – still does, but I love the process of growing my hair from scratch (sans chemicals). Getting it back to my version of controlled messiness.
