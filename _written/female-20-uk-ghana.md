I am half Ghanaian, but lived with my English mother who after 35 years of long blond tresses suddenly had to master tight African curls. It was so painful combing every week I used to do my homework to get out of it! If I wanted plaits she’d send me to Auntie Matilda up the road for 6 hours as a time. One day I wondered what would happen if I washed it and then just left it without braids – and I’ve had an afro for 6 years since, but I still haven’t learnt to braid…
