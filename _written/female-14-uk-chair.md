I can recall being sat in the chair as the hairdresser started the long labouring process of thermally straightening it. They always say it will take an hour tops and then I unleash my hair and they discover the layers and layers underneath. Because of this there’s usually a break where a black woman will not adhere to the stereotype and will eat a lot of chicken and chips before starting back on my hair. There’s usually several places of my skin that are burned but I can’t move because then their hand will slip.
