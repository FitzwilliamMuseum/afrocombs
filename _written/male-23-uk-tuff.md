I remember my hair being tuff and being sat in between my mum’s legs with my head being ragged about and get conked in my head for moaning and moving my head when getting it canerowed. I can remember teeth breaking in my hair or the iron comb burning my scalp or ears. I can remember relaxing my hair to strengthen my hair to smoothen. The pain when combing my hair out and I remember ripping knots out the end of my braids and I can remember my hair being cornrowed too tight and it hurting. And I couldn’t sleep and when it’s too tight it leaves bumps on the back of your head.
