When I was 4 my mom relaxed my hair and I never knew what natural hair felt like until I was 18. This was when I cut my hair and decided to go natural and this has been the most liberating thing Iâ€™ve done. Growing up, however, I always wished to have hair that white people have because of the pain involved in combing black hair. For this reason, I think our parents need to teach us more about combing our hair and knowing how to groom it.
