I used to have relaxer in my hair and was very nervous about stopping this because it’s all I knew! Furthermore, it wasn’t entirely ‘popular’ and people said I shouldn’t be able to get a comb through it! I’ve been relaxer free for 2½ years now and I love it! I love the diversity of Afro hair and just experimenting with what is natural to me. I use a wide-tooth comb, does the trick!
