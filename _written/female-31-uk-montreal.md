I am known for changing my hair. In July 2013 – I went Montreal- cut my hair and probably going to keep it short. Before I used to spend £ 1500+ a year on my hair. Now I expect to spend £ 80-90 a year. I never hated my afro – just love trying new styles – which can be achieved with afro for less the cost.
