When I was 14 years old my best friend used to let me afro comb her hair (she was of Jamaican descent). I was always surprised how dry her hair could get and I still remember the smell of the coconut oil she would use to condition her hair before combing. I particularly remember her having an afro comb with folding handles which I thought was very cool.
