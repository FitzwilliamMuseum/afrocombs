I recall my first day in the army in 1971. We were lined up in alphabetical order and my name begins with a ‘B’. Despite being mixed heritage (English and Nigerian) my hair was tight curled and I had an abundance of it. The barber was not happy because my hair tangled up the new electrical clippers. When he had future haircuts he insisted the Africans and half-casts (as the likes of me were called in those days) were to queue at the end in case his clippers got tangled up again!
