Until me early teens I always used and Afro comb but then I chemically straightened it and stopped. The regular combs are too small to go through my natural hair. Now I’m natural again and I’ve gone back to the afro comb. It is part of my heritage and I believe all black people should own one even if they don’t have hair. It is a physical object that the Diaspora can have to remember where we are from and who we are and have pride in ourselves.
