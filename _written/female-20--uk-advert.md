When I was 6, I saw this L’Oreal advertisement about a children’s shampoo. I begged and begged my mum to buy it for me, anticipating that if I used it, my hair could come out like the blond girl’s in the ad. It didn’t. And I cried the whole time my mum blow dried it and braided it. “It” being my hair- I no longer refer to my hair this way.
