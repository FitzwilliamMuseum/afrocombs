As a child I could not brush my hair, or comb it. I couldn’t bear to have it brushed, and the idea of my mother combing it was torture. As a teenager I alternated between very short cut hair or a mass of matted dreadlocks. As far as I know there is no African blood in my family. My dad has quite tight curly hair, my mum’s was wavy.
