I was born in 1945 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Throughout my growing-up years, I tried to make my curly/kinky hair straight using brush rollers at night, or a clothes iron, or tape to tape down my bangs or ‘spit curls’. I always hated damp, humid weather since, by the time I got to school, my hair would be all frizzy again – not the popular style at all. Finally, in the 60s I grew my hair into an Afro style, using combs like those in the exhibit. I am a Caucasian Jew and my curly hair (natural) is now gray.
