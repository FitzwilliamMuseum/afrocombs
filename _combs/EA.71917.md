{% include structure/image.html %}

Wooden comb originally with six teeth but one of the end ones is wanting. The handle ends in a zoomorphic(?) terminal and is decorated along the edges with serrations. Four shallow grooves across the face join the serrations and two are found immediately above the teeth. A single circular hole is placed centrally towards the terminal and four are arranged aboveâ€¦
