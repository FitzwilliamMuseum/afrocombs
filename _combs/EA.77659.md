Slightly less than one-half of a carved, very fine grained, smooth, light brown wooden comb which has 16 complete fine, closely spaced teeth on one side (6.5 teeth per cm). There are 5 broken teeth on one side of the 16 complete ones and 4 broken ones on the other. The complete teeth vary between 22mm and 26mm long. One end is charred and appears to have been rounded.
