{% include structure/image.html %}

A wooden comb, broken at one end, the other end incomplete. Carved from hardwood to produce narrow tapering teeth which are quite close together, 16 of which are preserved. The base has a rectangular cross-section and on one side includes a groove along its length above the teeth, the other side is decorated with an incised pair of shallow parallel lines.
