Crystal is the author of [UnitedKinKdom.blogspot.com](http://www.theunitedkinkdom.com/) a blog about afro textured hair which she uses as a platform both to celebrate and discuss issues relating to the Natural Hair Community in Great Britain. Since beginning the blog in 2011, Crystal has become one of an increasingly popular number of natural hair bloggers in the UK.

The use of online blogs and social media is currently playing a very important part in educating a generation of young Black women about Afro hair care. Crystal is looking forward to engaging many other "Online Naturals" with the Origins of The Afro Comb project.
