Patricia Brown represents community members on the 'Origins of the Afro Comb' committee. A big part of her role is to encourage other people to become involved with the project.

> "It is my kind of project, because most of all, I do believe that all Black people today can say something of significance about the afro comb. Since being involved in the project I now look at the afro comb with renewed respect as an invaluable treasure chest from the ancient past to the present day".

Patricia thoroughly enjoys learning and sharing the discoveries that the project has made so far- from the general public, community people, and people who are taking part in the prison project.

> "It is very exciting being part of a diverse and committed team who are working enthusiastically towards the ground-breaking aim to document 21st Century stories relating to the afro comb".
