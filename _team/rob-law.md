Rob Law has been working as a technician in the antiquities department at The Fitzwilliam Museum since January 2012. Having studied fine art at Liverpool Polytechnic in the 1980's, he went on to spend most of the 1990's working as an artist in Manchester.

Gradually becoming disillusioned with the art world, he went on to study for a BA and MA in archaeology at the University of Manchester before moving to Cambridge in 2004 to carry out research into British Early Bronze Age pottery. He gained his PhD in 2008. Rob's been fascinated with African Art since the early 1980's, even travelling to Paris last year to see the first ever large scale exhibition dedicated to West African Vodun sculpture. He's really looking forward to working on the African Comb's exhibition.
