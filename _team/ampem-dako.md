Ampem Dako is a young, up and coming writer, artist/performer, who is volunteering for the Afro Comb Project. He thinks the skills he can bring to the committee are, enthusiasm, willingness to help with decisions and a passion for Black History.

>"Afro Combs are particularly special to me as I used to have long hair and over the years me and my afro comb became inseparable, I would keep his teeth clean and parade him around and in turn he would keep my hair knot free and manageable"
